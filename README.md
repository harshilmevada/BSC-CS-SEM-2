# Step
First install numpy in your pc with this command.

## 1.Installation
```bash
pip install numpy
```
1. First user input to start program Enter : **1**
2. Second user input to Enter Equation for example
- `x**3 + 9*x + 1`,
- `10**x + np.sin(np.radians(x)) + 2*x`<br>
(x**3 means X to the power 3 in python)

### Before you goto next step you want to find ***f*** is in (Lower bond,Upper bond) you own
---

3. Third user input to Enter
for example put x = 0 to f(x) in above function ans is 1 > 0  
if value > 0 than it is **Upper bound**

4. Fourth user input to Enter
for example put x = -1 to f(x) in above function ans is -9 < 0  
if value < 0 than it is **Lower bound**

5. Fifth user input is fractional part
How main value you want in fractional part  
for example

- 2 => 223.45  
- 3 => 223.454  
- 4 => 223.4543 (by default)  

6. Sixth user input is loop
for example we get answer in 7th position than Enter : **7**
- by default it is 10 than don't Enter anything just press **Enter**

# Example
1. `f(x) = 10**x + np.sin(np.radians(x)) + 2*x`  
2. `f(0) = 1 + sin(0) + 2(0) => 1 > 0 is Upper bound`
3. `f(-1) = 1 + sin(-1) + 2(-1) => -2.1175 < 0 is lower bound`
